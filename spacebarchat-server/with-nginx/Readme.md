Set the following environment variables in your environment (adapt POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD,MAIL_CERTBOT,NGINX_HOST):

`export POSTGRES_USER=postgres`
`export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres`
`export POSTGRES_DATABASE=spacebarchat`
`export MAIL_CERTBOT=test@test.test`
`export NGINX_HOST=domain.de`

This clones the master banch into a docker builder and run a build before starting it.
To run it you need docker and docker-compose
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up` or `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d`

At first start you get an
